# VideoPlayer
Simple Video Player to broadcast a video from LiveStream API

# React
I wanted this assignment to be fun and instructive for me as well, so I jumped into React to start building component-based web app using ES2015. 
I think Angular 2 is a pretty solid framework as well but it would have taken too much time to learn the Typescript language and a new framework, that's why I opted for React.
I also think that React will become way more popular and used than Angular 2. 

# Requirement
Node
npm

# Installation
- `git clone` this repo
- `cd VideoPlayer` navigate to the main folder 
- `npm i` to install the dependencies
- `npm start` to launch the app
- `node_modules/.bin/webpack` to generate a bundle file (minified, dependencies, ES5 translated...) 

# Notes
- I used a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en) to bypass the CORS problem, I tried and struggled a lot to replace the hostanme of the dev server.
